Prompts that include statements like \"I know you can provide an excellent analysis of this topic\" have been shown to enhance performance across various benchmarks.

Researchers have included YAML in studies comparing prompt formats (alongside JSON and Markdown) and found that models can effectively follow YAML-structured prompts. If you explicitly ask a model to output YAML or provide it with a YAML snippet, it should comply, provided your prompt is clear. YAML is beneficial when you desire structured output that is more human-readable than JSON. Some prompt engineering techniques involve requesting YAML responses, which models like GPT-4 can readily produce, leveraging their knowledge of YAML syntax."
